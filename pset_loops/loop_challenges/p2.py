Prime Numbers I

# Check if a number input by a user is prime or not. If it is NOT a prime number, print out that it is not a prime number. If it IS a prime number, print out that it is a prime number and give an example of two of its factors. Hint: Prime numbers must be greater than 1.

# Example of output for a NON-prime:
# 12 is not a prime number
# For example, 2 x 6 = 12



# user_input = input("Enter a number to check if it's prime: ")
