# Rewrite p1, but this time use the input() command to solicit user input for name, price, quantity. Here's how it works:

item_name_1 = input('Name your first item: ') 
	# ^ this will ask user to input value of item_name_1

# use input() function and ask user to name items
item_name_1 = None
item_name_2 = None
item_name_3 = None
item_name_4 = None
item_name_5 = None

# use input() function and ask user to name prices
item_price_1 = None
item_price_2 = None
item_price_3 = None
item_price_4 = None
item_price_5 = None

# use input() function and ask user to name quants
item_quant_1 = None
item_quant_2 = None
item_quant_3 = None
item_quant_4 = None
item_quant_5 = None

# Print to the console the name and price of each item defined above as follows:
# 1 Coco Puffs = $8.95.
# where:
# 1 would be item_quant_1
# Coco Puffs would be item_name_1
# 8.95 would be item_name_2

# JUST REMEMBER: now this will be defined by the user!!
