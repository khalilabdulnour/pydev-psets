## Getting Started

CD into the directory

```bash
cd pydev-psets
```

Then, build:

```bash
. ./activate
```

Then, `cd` into the pset you want to solve and run:

```bash
invoke test
```

To test your code manually, just run:

```bash
python {filename.py}
```

Done!

## Dev notes

To watch / build tests:

```bash
$ invoke watch
```
