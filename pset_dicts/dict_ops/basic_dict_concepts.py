Basic Dict Concepts
"""


# 1. Declare an empty dict as d1.



# 2. Create a dict called d2 containing the first and last names below:
# Anthony Paollelo, Ping Qiao, Enrique Alvarez, Arjun Dhir 




# 3. Add a person to d2.



# 4. How many people are now in d2? Print out all their *first* names.



# 5. Delete a random person from d2 and print his/her name.



# 6. Re-add the name you deleted to the end of d2.



# 7. Alphabetize the list by last name.
