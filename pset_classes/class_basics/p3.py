# Create a hierarchy of 3 classes with parent child relationships: Vehicle > Car > Brand of Car.
# Vehicle should have a class attribute for category ('transportion') and a method called "start_engine()" that prints "Vroom!"
# Car should have motion and terrin class attributes ('drive' and 'land' respectively). It should also have a method called "honk_horn()" that prints "HONK!"
# The brand class should have attributes for brand name, plates, owner, fuel, and max speed in MPH. It should have a method called "describe()" that prints out all these details.

# Once done creating these, instantiate at least one instance object for each class. Access attributes and call methods belonging to each instance's class and its parent class. Note that the third class will be child to BOTH Vehicle AND Car.
