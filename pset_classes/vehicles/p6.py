# Next, define new method called "check_fuel_level()" for your newly expanded Car class. If the fuel_level attribute is < 15, the method should reset fuel_level to 50 and print out how many units it refueled the car, e.g. 'Refueled 38 units.' Otherwise, it should simply print 'No need to refuel right now.'

# Create at least TWO instances of Car, one of which has a fuel level below 15. Access the new attributes and call the check_fuel_level() method for each instance.
